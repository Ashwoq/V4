# PORTAL V4

I used Blender and Three.js to create my first 3D website. You can check it out [here](https://portal-v4.vercel.app/).

# Another Project - GAMEBOY AD

I recently started working on a new 3D project using Spline. This project represents my first foray into using Spline for 3D web design. You can view this project [here](https://gameboy-ad.web.app/).

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

## Run the local server
npm run dev

```
